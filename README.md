# Hate_Speech_Classification

## Intro to project
### Background:
In today's digital age, social media platforms and online forums have become breeding grounds for hate speech, which can propagate harmful ideologies and contribute to the proliferation of discrimination and violence. Detecting and mitigating hate speech online is crucial to fostering inclusive and safe online environments.

### Objective:
